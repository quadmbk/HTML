1. Inline Display: The default display for some elements, such as <em>, <strong>, and <a>, is called inline. Inline elements have a box that wraps tightly around their content, only taking up the amount of space necessary to display their content and not requiring a new line after each element. inline elements cannot be altered in size with the height or width CSS properties. The CSS display property provides the ability to make any element an inline element. This includes elements that are not inline by default such as paragraphs, divs, and headings. The browser will then render the inline marked elements in the same line with other surrounding inline elements. CSS Rule: display:inline;
2. Block display: Such elements can have a width and height CSS rule. CSS Rule: display:block;
3. Inline-Block: Inline-block display combines features of both inline and block elements. Inline-block elements can appear next to each other and we can specify their dimensions using the width and height properties. Images are the best example of default inline-block elements.
